<h2>Help</h2>

    <p> If you entered college is not working, it could be for one of these reasons: <br>
            1. The college you entered is not a 4-year undergraduate college <br>
            2. The name was spelled incorrectly <br>
            3. Not all of the letters are lowercase <br>
            4. You did not hyphenate the specific campus (For example, "university of maryland-college park") <br>
    </p>
